      "The contractor installs the wrong cable. The Engineer instructs a replacement. Is this a variation?",
    options: ["Not a variation", "Is a variation"],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "Correcting defective work isn't a variation — it's enforcement of an obligation the contractor already had.",

    id: "variation-02",
    topic: "Variations",
    scenario:
      "A junior site engineer (not the named Engineer under the contract) emails the contractor asking for an extra access ramp. Should the contractor treat this as an instructed variation?",
    options: [
      "Confirm authority before treating it as a variation",
      "Just proceed, an instruction is an instruction",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "A variation instruction only binds the parties if it comes from someone with contractual authority to give it. Acting on the wrong person's say-so is a good way to end up with unauthorised work and no entitlement to be paid for it.",
  },

    id: "variation-03",
    topic: "Variations",
    scenario:
      "The contractor spots an obvious drawing error (a beam clashing with a duct) and fixes it on site without telling anyone, then claims it as a variation.",
    options: [
      "No automatic entitlement without an instruction",
      "Yes, fixing an error is always a variation",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "Discovering a problem doesn't create an entitlement — flag it and get an instruction before acting, rather than deciding unilaterally and invoicing for it afterwards.",
  },
  {
    id: "variation-04",
    topic: "Variations",
    scenario:
      "The contract requires all variations to be instructed in writing. The Engineer verbally tells the contractor to add extra reinforcement, then later refuses to confirm it in writing.",
    options: [
      "Get it in writing, or confirm the verbal instruction back yourself",
      "Proceed anyway, verbal instructions are just as good",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "If the contract requires written instructions, relying on a verbal one is risky — at minimum, send a written confirmation of the verbal instruction so there's a record if it's later disputed.",

    scenario:
      "The contractor's completed work fails to meet the specified concrete strength. The Engineer instructs the contractor to break out and redo it at the contractor's own cost.",
    options: ["Not a variation — contractor bears the cost", "A variation — contractor should be paid extra"],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "Rectifying your own defective work is an existing contractual obligation, not new scope. No variation, no extra payment — the cost sits with the party who caused the defect.",

    id: "defects-02",
    topic: "Defects",
    scenario:
      "The Employer starts using part of the building before formal handover. A defect appears in that section afterward — is the contractor still liable to fix it?",

      "Generally yes, unless the defect was caused by the Employer's use",
      "No, early occupation ends the contractor's liability",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "Early occupation doesn't automatically release the contractor from defects liability — but it does become relevant if the defect was actually caused by how the Employer used the space, not by the original work.",
  },

    id: "defects-03",

    scenario:
      "The contractor disputes that a cracked tile is a defect, arguing it's normal wear and tear from the Employer's use after handover.",

      "Distinguish inherent defects from post-handover wear before assuming liability",
      "Contractor is always responsible for anything wrong during the defects period",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "Not everything that goes wrong during the defects liability period is a defect in the contractual sense — genuine wear and tear from normal use is a different question from a fault in the original work.",
  },

    id: "defects-04",
    topic: "Defects",
    scenario:
      "A defect is identified after the defects liability period has ended, in work that turns out to have been seriously substandard from the start.",

      "May still be pursued as a latent defect — not automatically time-barred",
      "Once the defects period ends, the contractor is fully off the hook",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "The defects liability period covers routine snagging, not a free pass on seriously defective work — genuinely latent defects discovered later can potentially still be pursued, subject to the contract's and law's limitation periods.",

  // --- Payment ---
  {
    id: "payment-01",
    topic: "Payment",
    scenario:
      "The contractor's payment claim includes work priced at full value that hasn't actually been carried out yet. Should the Engineer certify it in full?",
    options: ["No, certify only what's done", "Yes, certify the full claim"],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "Certify what's been executed and verified. Certifying unperformed work isn't supported by the contract, whatever the claim says.",
  },
  {
    id: "payment-02",
    topic: "Payment",
    scenario:
      "The contractor submits a payment claim after the contractual deadline for submission. Must the Engineer still assess and certify it as normal?",
    options: [
      "Check what the contract says about late claims before assuming either way",
      "Always certify it regardless of timing",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "Payment procedures — submission deadlines, required form, supporting documents — are usually contractual requirements, not just formalities. Check them before assuming a late or non-compliant claim must still be processed as normal.",
  },
  {
    id: "payment-03",
    topic: "Payment",
    scenario:
      "The contractor's payment claim bundles variation work together with the main contract works, without breaking out the variation separately.",
    options: ["Ask for it to be itemised before certifying", "Certify the lump sum as claimed"],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "Variations should normally be valued and substantiated separately from the main works — a bundled claim makes it hard to check what you're actually agreeing to pay for.",
  },
  {
    id: "payment-04",
    topic: "Payment",
    scenario:
      "The Employer wants to withhold payment for undisputed, properly certified work because of a separate, unrelated dispute with the contractor on another matter.",
    options: [
      "Check the contract for a proper right of set-off before withholding",
      "Withholding is fine as long as there's a dispute somewhere",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "You generally can't withhold payment for properly certified work just because there's a dispute about something else — most regimes require a specific, notified right of set-off, not a general 'we'll hold this until we sort out that other thing.'",
  },

  // --- LD ---
  {
    id: "ld-01",
    topic: "LD",
    scenario:
      "Completion is delayed, but the only cause was a variation the Engineer instructed. Can the Employer still deduct the full liquidated damages?",
    options: ["No", "Yes, delay is delay"],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "LDs are for contractor-culpable delay. Delay caused by the Employer's own instruction should be covered by an extension of time, not penalised.",
  },
  {
    id: "ld-02",
    topic: "LD",
    scenario:
      "Completion is delayed by both a contractor resourcing problem and a late Employer instruction, happening in the same period.",

      "This needs careful apportionment, not an automatic full LD deduction",
      "Deduct full LDs since the contractor was partly at fault",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "Concurrent delay — genuinely overlapping causes, one the contractor's fault and one not — isn't a clean case for full LDs. It needs proper analysis of what caused what, not a default to penalise the contractor for the whole period.",
  },
  {
    id: "ld-03",
    topic: "LD",
    scenario:
      "The contract's LD clause has no stated cap, and the calculated LDs after a long delay now exceed the total contract value.",
    options: [
      "Flag this early — a disproportionate LD figure is a real risk to check, not just apply mechanically",
      "LDs always apply exactly as calculated, no matter how large",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "An LD figure that ends up wildly disproportionate to the contract value is a genuine legal and commercial risk area — this is a case to get proper advice on, not just apply mechanically.",
  },
  {
    id: "ld-04",
    topic: "LD",
    scenario:
      "The Employer wants to deduct LDs for delay, but never issued a certificate of non-completion as required by the contract.",
    options: [
      "Check the contract's precondition — a missing certificate can block the LD deduction",
      "The certificate is just paperwork, deduct the LDs anyway",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "Many contracts make a certificate of non-completion (or equivalent) a precondition to deducting LDs. Skipping that step isn't just sloppy administration — it can genuinely undermine the right to deduct at all.",

    topic: "EOT",
    scenario:
      "The contractor claims an extension of time for a rain day, but provides no programme evidence the rain actually affected the critical path.",
    options: ["Insufficient on its own", "Grant it, rain is rain"],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "An EOT needs evidence the event affected the critical path — not just that the event happened somewhere on site.",
  },
  {
    id: "eot-02",
    topic: "EOT",
    scenario:
      "The contractor submits an EOT claim three months after the delay event, when the contract requires notice within 28 days.",
    options: [
      "Late notice is a real problem — don't wave it through just because the delay was genuine",
      "The delay was real, so grant the EOT regardless of timing",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "A genuine delay event doesn't override a contractual notice requirement — treat late notice as a real issue to assess against what the contract actually says, not an inconvenience to overlook.",
  },
  {
    id: "eot-03",
    topic: "EOT",
    scenario:
      "The contractor claims an EOT for a general 'series of delays' without linking any of them to specific programme impacts.",
    options: [
      "Ask for the claim to be substantiated against the programme, not accepted as a general assertion",
      "Grant a reasonable-sounding EOT since something clearly went wrong",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "A vague, unlinked global claim is hard to assess fairly. A proper EOT claim should trace specific events to specific programme impact, not just assert that delay happened somewhere.",
  },
  {
    id: "eot-04",
    topic: "EOT",
    scenario:
      "An EOT is due for a genuine Employer-caused delay, but the contractor was already running behind schedule for its own reasons before that delay occurred.",
    options: [
      "The EOT should reflect only the net critical-path impact, not a full extension regardless of pre-existing delay",
      "Grant the full extension since the Employer caused this particular delay",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "An EOT protects the completion date from events that aren't the contractor's fault — it isn't meant to also erase delay the contractor already caused itself. Isolate the actual critical-path impact of the compensable event.",
  },

      "The contract requires written notice of a compensation event within a set number of days. The contractor only mentions the issue verbally in a site meeting.",
    options: ["Verbal doesn't count — get it in writing", "Raised is raised, notice served"],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "A verbal mention isn't a substitute for the contractual notice. Don't let an issue sit on 'we mentioned it at the meeting.'",
  },
  {
    id: "notices-02",
    topic: "Notices",
    scenario:
      "The contract requires notice 'as soon as practicable.' The contractor waits six weeks, arguing that's still reasonably prompt given the circumstances.",
    options: [
      "'As soon as practicable' still means promptly once the event is known — don't treat a flexible standard as unlimited time",
      "Any timeframe is fine as long as the contractor has a justification",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "A flexible notice standard isn't a blank cheque — it's still meant to mean promptly, given what was actually happening. A long, unexplained delay is exactly what these clauses are meant to catch.",
  },
  {
    id: "notices-03",
    topic: "Notices",
    scenario:
      "The Engineer receives a notice that's clearly about a compensation event, but it's titled 'Site Memo' and doesn't cite the specific contract clause.",
    options: [
      "Assess it on substance — a notice doesn't have to use magic words to count",
      "Reject it because it doesn't cite the correct clause",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "Most regimes look at whether a notice substantively conveys what's required, not whether it uses the exact contractual label. Rejecting a real notice on a technicality is its own kind of risk.",
  },
  {
    id: "notices-04",
    topic: "Notices",
    scenario:
      "A subcontractor's delay is caused by a late instruction to the main contractor, but the main contractor never passes on formal notice to the Employer, assuming the Employer 'already knows.'",
    options: [
      "Send the notice anyway — assumed awareness isn't a substitute for a formal notice where the contract requires one",
      "Skip it, if the Employer already knows there's no need",
    ],
    correctIndex: 0,
    explanation:
      "This is the same trap as relying on a site-meeting mention — actual knowledge doesn't reliably substitute for the formal notice mechanism the contract sets up. Send it, even if it feels redundant.",
